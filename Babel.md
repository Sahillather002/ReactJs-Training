Babel is a compiler that turns ES6 code into ES5 code.
This process is called transpiling.

We can have ES6 or latest ES Next code and 
it will run in all browsers.

Babel can convert JSX code into vanilla JS that
our browser can interpret and run , with the help 
of react preset .

Preset is set of plugins used to support particular language features.

Support for react , es2015 is always there means that their preset is always there.
react : add support for JSX , es2015 : add support for es6 syntax.
